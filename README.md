# Acres Server Mod

The 13 Acres of Hell Server Mod (Acres) is a (mostly) server side mod that combines and modified a number of other mods to provide a robust deathmatch experience. 

 

●     Based on the Reincarnation server side mod by Gen, Gonzo, and Bal.

○     Reincarnation provides a range of multi-player quality of life features and gameplay adjustments.  Most are basic (i.e. deathmatch 3 mode and power up drops), but there also some fun templay options and modes included.

○     Acres mod improves functionality and handling of rune mode

○     Acres mod improves functionality and handling of grappling hook (offhand hook added)

○     Acres mod adds weapon rebalancing (see notes below)

○     Acres mod fixes some minor bugs and issues in the original reincarnation mod.

●     Integrated Multiskin mod with my own curated selection of 32 player skins (see PDF chart showing off the skins)

●     Integrates the FrikBot mod, with bots using 16 of the new multi-skins.

●     This mod is intended to be used alongside a curated archive of deathmatch maps with pre-set and customizable map rotation support included. Frikbot waypoints are provided for most of the maps.
